# Features
- Easy-to-Use Interface: WeatherWhisper provides a hassle-free experience with an elegant and straightforward user interface. Simply enter the name of your desired city, click "Get Weather," and get instant weather updates!

- Switchable Temperature Units: WeatherWhisper lets you view temperatures in both Celsius and Fahrenheit units. Just click the "Switch Units" button to toggle between them.

- Real-Time Data: The application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, ensuring you receive up-to-date and accurate weather information.

- Error Handling: WeatherWhisper gracefully handles various scenarios, such as invalid city names, connection errors, and API-related issues, ensuring a smooth user experience.

# Getting Started
To use Weather Whisper, you'll need to obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).. Don't worry; it's a quick and easy process! Just follow the steps provided in the [Setup Guide](https://openweathermap.org/appid) to acquire your API key and configure the application.


# Dependencies
You'll need the following dependencies installed in your Python environment:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): The programming language used to build the application.
- [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html): The standard GUI library for Python.
- [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/): A powerful HTTP library to make API requests.
- [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html): A module to work with configuration files.

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip. For example:

```bash
pip install requests
```

# How to run 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries (tkinter, requests, configparser) installed.
3. Add your API key to the config.ini file as per the provided Setup Guide.
4. Run the weatherwhisper.py script to launch the WeatherWhisper application.


# Base Code - Fetch Weather Data with OpenWeatherMap API
```python
import requests

API_KEY = "(Insert your own API Key"
BASE_URL = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"

city = input("Enter a city name")
request_url = f"{BASE_URL}?appid={API_KEY}&q={city}"
response = requests.get(request_url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    weather = data['weather'][0]['description']
    temperature = round(data["main"]["temp"] * 1.8 - 459.67)
    feels_like = round(data["main"]["feels_like"] * 1.8 - 459.67)

    print("Weather:", weather)
    print("Temperature:", temperature, "°F")
    print("It Feels Like:", feels_like, "°F")
else:
    print("not valid, Please try again.")
```

Please note that this base code is intended to demonstrate how to fetch weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API using the requests library. For the full functionality and GUI application, you can refer to the WeatherWhisper project provided in this repository.

## The explanation
I wanted to provide a step-by-step explanation of the code:

Importing the ```requests``` library: The script starts by importing the ```requests``` library, which allows making HTTP requests to external APIs.

Setting up ```API_KEY``` and ```BASE_URL```: The API_KEY variable holds the API key required to access the OpenWeatherMap API. You need to replace ```"insert api key from OpenWeatherMap"``` with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap. The ```BASE_URL``` variable holds the base URL for the OpenWeatherMap API endpoint for fetching weather data.

Getting user input: The script prompts the user to enter the name of a city. The city name is read from the standard input using the ```input()``` function and stored in the ```city``` variable.

Building the request URL: The ```request_url``` variable is constructed using an f-string (formatted string literals) to include the API key and the city name as query parameters in the URL.

Sending the API request: The script sends an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the ```requests.get()``` function with the constructed ```request_url```. The response from the API is stored in the ```response``` variable.

Processing the API response: The script checks the status code of the response using ```response.status_code```. If the status code is 200 (OK), it means the API call was successful, and it proceeds to extract weather data from the JSON response.

Extracting weather data: The JSON data from the API response is parsed using ```response.json()```, and specific weather details such as the weather description, temperature, and feels-like temperature are extracted from the JSON data.

Converting temperature to Fahrenheit: The temperature values retrieved from the API response are in Kelvin. The script converts them to Fahrenheit by applying the appropriate formula (1 Kelvin = -459.67 °F).

Printing the weather information: If the API call was successful, the script prints the weather description, temperature in Fahrenheit, and feels-like temperature in Fahrenheit.

Handling invalid requests: If the API call was not successful (status code other than 200), the script prints "not valid, Please try again."

Please note (i know this is the second time i've said it) that to run this code successfully, you need to have a valid API key from OpenWeatherMap and the requests library installed in your Python environment. You can install the requests library using the following command:

```bash
pip install requests
```


# config.ini - Configuration File for Weather Whisper
The config.ini file plays a crucial role in the WeatherWhisper application, as it securely stores the API key required to access the OpenWeatherMap API. This configuration file ensures that the sensitive API key remains separate from the application's code, enhancing security and maintainability.

### purpose
The purpose of the config.ini file is to provide a centralized location for storing configuration parameters and settings that can be easily accessed and modified without altering the application's source code. In the case of WeatherWhisper, it serves as a container for the API key required to make requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.

### How to use
When setting up WeatherWhisper for the first time, the user needs to obtain their personal API key from the OpenWeatherMap website. Once obtained, the user must open the config.ini file with a text editor and replace the placeholder "your_api_key_here" with their actual API key. It is crucial to ensure that the API key is kept confidential and not shared with others, as it grants access to the OpenWeatherMap API under the user's account.


### Enhancing Security
By storing the API key in the config.ini file, WeatherWhisper avoids hardcoding sensitive information directly into the source code. This practice enhances security by reducing the risk of accidental exposure of the API key or unwanted disclosure when sharing code repositories with other developers.

### Wrap Up
The config.ini file is a vital component of WeatherWhisper, providing a safe and convenient way to store the API key necessary for accessing real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. By using this configuration file, WeatherWhisper demonstrates best practices for secure and configurable application development.
